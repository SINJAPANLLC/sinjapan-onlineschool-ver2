# SIN JAPAN ONLINE SCHOOL

## Overview
SIN JAPAN ONLINE SCHOOL is a comprehensive online learning platform providing quality education through professional instructors. The platform has been completely transformed from a social media/fan platform into an educational platform, featuring course catalogs, instructor dashboards, student-instructor communication, and comprehensive learning management. The platform tagline is "あなたの未来を一緒に創る" (Creating your future together).

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with clear communication on changes. Please ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. For UI/UX, maintain the consistent blue gradient design throughout all pages. Ensure all interactive elements have `data-testid` attributes for testing purposes.

## System Architecture
The platform features a React frontend built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for animations, and i18next for internationalization. The backend utilizes Express.js for API endpoints. **Firebase (school-ec82e project)** is the primary data store, providing user authentication, Firestore Database for all application data, Realtime Database for messaging, and Firebase Storage for user-uploaded media. Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud Storage-based) handles large course video files. Square payment integration handles all monetary transactions.

**Key Features:**
*   **User Management**: Secure authentication via Firebase, student and instructor profiles with KYC/Identity verification for instructors.
*   **Course System**: Course creation, enrollment, video lessons, learning progress tracking, ratings and reviews.
*   **Student-Instructor Communication**: Real-time messaging via Firebase Realtime Database with unread indicators.
*   **Monetization**: Course pricing, payment processing via Stripe, instructor earnings tracking, payment withdrawal system.
*   **Ranking System**: Course rankings and student leaderboards.
*   **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management for students, instructors, courses, revenue, reports, and analytics.
*   **Instructor Dashboard**: Course analytics, student engagement metrics, earnings tracking, and course management.
*   **Notifications**: Push and email notifications for course updates and messages.

**Terminology Standardization:**
*   **投稿** → **コース** (Courses)

*   **ユーザー** → **学生** (Students)
*   All pages consistently use educational terminology
